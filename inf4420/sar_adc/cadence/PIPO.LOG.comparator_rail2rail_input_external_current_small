WARNING (XSTRM-20): Output Stream file '/ifi/bifrost/m00/vegardmi/work/github/collaborate/inf4420/sar_adc/cadence/comparator_rail2rail_input_external_current_small.calibre.db' already exists. It will be overwritten.

INFO (XSTRM-162): You have not used the viaMap option. If the OpenAccess design has native oaVia instances, use the -viaMap option for preserving oaVia instances in a Stream Out - Stream In round trip. Using the -viaMap option improves performance and VM usage of applications using the Streamed-In design.  For details on the viaMap option, refer to the "Design Data Translator's Reference" guide for XStream.
