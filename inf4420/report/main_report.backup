\part{Introduction}

To test my designs I started with simulating and making the la
yout for a
350nm chip. This process was a fairly straight forward proce
ss as several
chips in this process has been design at the group. This chip r
esulted in a
working parallel and serial multiplier. Also test elements
of structures used
in the respective multipliers was made and available for tak
ing measure-
ments on this chip. An auto-zero element, the multiple-inpu
t semi-floating-
gate inverter and the memory module are among these test elem
ents. Dur-
ing the project a possibility for producing a chip in a for us n
ew technology,
a 112nm technology became available. Two fellow students wo
rking on an
ultra-wideband project had free pads on their chip and was wi
lling to let
me use some of the available pins. Originally I intended to ma
ke a 8x8
array-multiplier on this chip. But as we got more knowledge o
n the new
process we found several challenges. What affected my test e
lement on this
chip the most at first was that the number of pins was reduced. In
our ori-
ginal assessment of the availability of pins we thought it wo
uld be about as
on the other processes we knew where for instance one pin is en
ough for
Vdd for padframe and circuit elements and another pin for GND
for pad-
frame and circuit elements. But that was not the case here, no
t only was
it required to separate the pad-ring and the elements powers
upply, it was
also required to have powersupply pads for the padframe even
ly spaced
around the frame. Due to this the test element made for this ch
ip was re-
duced to a 2x2 parallel multiplier. Also the ultra-wideband
test elements
required possibilities for high frequency input and output
s. So a PCB was
produced to accommodate these requirements. Therefore I al
so construc-
ted my 120nm test element to be measured at a high frequency.
The two processes used in this thesis is of two different gene
rations when
it comes to CMOS processing. Whereas the 350 nm technology is a
s one
would expect, a process where the gate and line delay is reduc
ed from the
previous processes (600 and 800nm). The 120nm process may be
the first
35
process utilized here at this group where the gate delay cont
inues to reduce
in a new process, but the transmission delay between gates is
significant
increased. Resulting in more area available for design of lo
gic circuits, but
not necessary giving anything in the way of increase in speed
[23]. Other
challenges one faces utilizing minimum transistors in a pro
cess like the 120
nm process is the very short tunnel one gets under the gate of t
he transistor.
Also due to the small sizes of the structures in the 120nm proc
ess the poly
can not only be n-doped. The gate over the p-MOS is p-doped. Thi
s is to
make the p-MOS better.
4.1  The 350nm chip
The implementation in the 350 nm technology was done as a norm
al design
process. First the circuit was made in schematic to test the l
ogic functions
of the circuit. Then the system was transferred to layout and
further sim-
ulations was conducted to verify the design. Finally the des
ign was tested
physically by measuring on an actual chip.
The circuit elements implemented on the 350nm chip is made us
ing min-
imum sized transistors and as small capacitors as was practi
cal to balance
(5fF) as the minimum or unit capacitor. The circuits was desi
gned to func-
tion at a supply voltage of 2V. The circuit elements on this ch
ip was found
to be working as illustrated by the measurements of the paral
lel multiplier
in figure 4.1. The parallel multiplier multiplies two three bi
t numbers. The
serial multiplier implemented has only three memory elemen
ts limiting the
size of the numbers it can multiply.
On this chip I also implemented some of the circuits used in th
e system by
themselves so it would be possible to measure them on their ow
n. In figure
4.2 such a measurement is made of the auto-zero circuit. That
this circuit
functions properly is very important as it is used for all the
input-signals in
all the systems implemented.
4.2  The 120nm chip
Designing systemsin the 120nm process was more challenging
than design-
ing the systemfor the 350nm chip. The circuits on this chip wa
s designed to
function with a supply voltage of 900mV. As mentioned before
the pad-ring
was one obstacle. In the 350nm design I used simple poly poly c
apacitors
to make the needed capacitors for the design. In the 120nm pro
cess use
